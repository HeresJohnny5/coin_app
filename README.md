# Simple Coin Currency App

This is a coin currency app which will do the following:

1. Take the user's name
2. Ask the user to input an amount of change
3. The coin currency app will return an amount of change based on what the user inputs
	* For example:
	* 75 - Will return {:Quarter => 3}
	* 126 - Will return {:Dollar => 1, :Quarter => 1, :Penny => 1}
